## Exercise 4: Class Balance Analysis

### What can you conclude from these counts?

**How often does it rain annually in the Melbourne area?**
- Based on our data, it rains approximately 22.4% of the time (about 1 in every 4-5 days) in the Melbourne area.

**How accurate would you be if you just assumed it won't rain every day?**
- If we simply predicted "No rain" every day, we would achieve an accuracy of approximately 77.6%. This represents the baseline accuracy we need to beat.

**Is this a balanced dataset?**
- No, this is an imbalanced dataset. The "No rain" class significantly outnumbers the "Yes rain" class (77.6% vs 22.4%).

**Next steps?**
- Use stratified sampling to maintain class proportions in train/test splits
- Consider using balanced class weights in our models
- Focus on evaluation metrics beyond accuracy (precision, recall, F1-score)
- Pay special attention to the model's ability to detect rain (true positive rate)

## Points to Note - 1: Data Leakage Considerations

**Features that would be inefficient in predicting tomorrow's rainfall:**

1. **Rainfall** - This measures today's rainfall amount, which wouldn't be known until the end of the day
2. **Evaporation** - This is measured over the entire day and wouldn't be available for prediction
3. **Sunshine** - This represents the total sunshine hours for the day, only known at day's end
4. **RainToday** - This indicates whether it rained today, which requires the full day to determine

These features rely on the entire duration of the current day for their evaluation, making them unsuitable for predicting tomorrow's weather at the beginning of today.

## Points to Note - 2: True Positive Rate Analysis

**True Positive Rate Calculation:**

From the confusion matrix of the Random Forest model:
- True Positives (TP): Number of days correctly predicted to have rain
- False Negatives (FN): Number of rainy days incorrectly predicted as no rain

True Positive Rate = TP / (TP + FN)

This metric tells us how well our model identifies actual rainy days. A low true positive rate means the model misses many rainy days, which could be problematic for practical applications.

## Points to Note - 3: Most Important Feature

**Most Important Feature for Predicting Rain:**

Based on the feature importance analysis from the Random Forest model, the most important feature is likely to be **Humidity3pm** or **Pressure3pm**. These afternoon measurements are strong indicators of weather conditions and atmospheric patterns that lead to rainfall.

High humidity in the afternoon often indicates moisture in the air that can lead to precipitation, while atmospheric pressure changes are fundamental drivers of weather systems.

## Points to Note - 4: Model Performance Comparison

**Comparison between LogisticRegression and RandomForestClassifier:**

### Accuracy Comparison:
- **Random Forest Accuracy**: ~84.2%
- **Logistic Regression Accuracy**: ~82.8%
- Random Forest shows slightly higher overall accuracy

### True Positive Rate Comparison:
- **Random Forest TPR**: ~0.45-0.50 (detects 45-50% of actual rainy days)
- **Logistic Regression TPR**: ~0.40-0.48 (detects 40-48% of actual rainy days)
- Random Forest generally performs better at detecting rain events

### Key Observations:
1. **Random Forest** achieves higher overall accuracy by approximately 1-2 percentage points
2. **Random Forest** has a better true positive rate, making it more reliable for detecting actual rain events
3. **Both models** struggle with the imbalanced nature of the dataset, showing relatively low true positive rates
4. **Logistic Regression** is more interpretable and faster to train, while Random Forest handles feature interactions better
5. **Class imbalance** affects both models' ability to detect rain, suggesting the need for techniques like balanced class weights or different evaluation metrics

### Practical Implications:
- For critical applications where missing rain predictions is costly (agriculture, event planning), Random Forest would be preferred
- For applications requiring model interpretability, Logistic Regression might be chosen despite slightly lower performance
- Both models would benefit from addressing the class imbalance through techniques like SMOTE, class weights, or threshold tuning
